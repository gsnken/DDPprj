Welcome to the world of predictions
========================================================

We predict your Health, Wealth and Romance for the day using

- Birth date
- or Initials of your name
- Date
- Estimated Epsilon (not random) for unknowns

The server side script
========================================================
We see that the prediction for someone born during first 10 days of January, allowing for error epsillon, is -

```
[1] "your health today will be Good\nyour Fiannces today will  greatly increase\nyour romance today will be OK"
```

While that for someone with Initials "D.E." is -

```
[1] "your health today will be OK\nyour Fiannces today will  Lookup\nyour romance today will be OK"
```
The User interface 
========================================================
In the user interface, we use -
- Radio buttons
- Dropdown list boxes
- Conditional panels

Internally we also take into account the date.

Thank you
